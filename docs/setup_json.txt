There are two files you'll need to look at.

- clsave/config.json configures the game engine.
- clsave/pub/user.json configures your profile.

For more information on the JSON syntax, check out this website:
	http://json.org/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic introduction:

clsave/config.json:
	"video" section:
		"width" and "height" define the width and height of the
		screen/window.
		"fullscreen" can be either true or false (not in "quotes"!)
		
		You must either use a 24bpp or 32bpp screen mode.
		No 15/16bpp, sorry! And DEFINITELY NO 8BPP.
		
		"cubeshift" is for quality control.
		Increase it one at a time if it's slow.
		Decrease it one at a time if it looks awful.
		"1" is recommended, although it looks pixelated when you zoom in.

		Note, "cubeshift" does not affect the OpenGL renderer.

		"antialiasinglevel" sets antialiasing level for OpenGL
		"0" disable antialiasing (safe option for older hardware)
		"2" set multisamples to 2
		"4" set multisamples to 4
		The higher number, the better quality.
		The better quality, the slower.

		"smoothlighting" enables the display of smooth dark corners and
		shadows between cubes.
		Disable for a faster FPS.

		"gl_quality" sets the overall quality of OpenGL draw calls (default 1).
		A value of "0", sets the quality to fastest.
		A value of "1", sets the quality to nicest.
		Set it to "0" to draw things faster on older systems.

		"gl_expand_textures" expands textures to powers of 2 in OpenGL mode
		This is for backwards-compatibility with old graphics cards.
		Disable this unless all the text is white or something.

		"gl_chunk_size" sets the size of the map chunks in OpenGL mode
		The bigger chunks are, the more time it will take to rebuild them when
		modified.
		Recommended value is 16.

		"gl_chunks_tesselated_per_frame" number of chunks to tessellate per
		frame.
		The more chunks are tesselated per frame, the more stutter may be
		encountered.
		A recommended value would be "2" (or "1" for slower computers).

		"gl_shaders" enables GLSL shaders (default: true).
		If your card does not support these, it SHOULD fall back.
		If you are having issues, you can turn these off.
		NOTE: not supported yet - this will be ignored.

		"gl_frustum_cull" enables 2D-space frustum culling for chunks (default: true)
		Set this to "false" if the artifacts are digging your head in,
		or if it somehow makes rendering *slower*.

		"gl_flip_quads" changes the order in which quads are assembled.
		Enable this if you have smooth lighting enabled and it looks like you have dark squares
		at each of the corners.

		"gl_vbo" enables vertex buffer objects (default: true)
		May fail on older computers. Enable for a faster FPS.
		It is recommended you disable these on old Intel integrated GPUs.
		More modern ones, such as the Sandy/Ivy Bridge series, will benefit from this.

	"audio" section:
		"freq" is the master audio sampling frequency in Hz, as usual.
		"channels" is how many channels you can output to;
		  typically you'll leave this at 2 for stereo.
		"bits" is how many bits per sample - must be 16 or 8.
		
		"volume" is a volume multiplier.
		Best to leave this at 1.0.
	
	"security" section:
		"bin_storage_allowed" allows/disallows saving of files to vol/ directories.
		Set this to "false" if you are in any way worried about a server possibly
		crapflooding your Iceball install.
		Best to leave this set to "true" until we get better security.

		"raw_whitelist" lists pairs of addresses/ports that can be opened/accessed.
		Each port number allows both the TCP *AND* UDP port at that number to be accessed.
		Each address pair is a 2-entry list.

		The addresses MUST be EXACTLY the same as requested,
		e.g. voxelauth.com and www.voxelauth.com are NOT the same IP.

clsave/pub/user.json:
	"name" should be set to something other than null or the empty string,
	otherwise, the game will give you a random name.

	"kick_on_join" should be false.
	Servers can be set up to check this and kick if this is true
	if they want to limit their playerbase to people who can read.
	The check is off by default, but you might as well set this to false yourself.

	"sensitivity" is mouse sensitivity.
	it takes 1000/sensitivity pixels to rotate by 180 degrees.

	"hold_to_zoom" determines scoping style.
	Set to false if you prefer to toggle to aim.

	"frame_limit" sets the maximum FPS for the game.
	Set to 0 if you don't want an FPS limit.
	This is broken prior to 0.1.2-12.

	"fog" is the fog distance.
	0 means "use the server defined maximum".
	If you have an old/budget graphics card/chip, 60 is a good value.
	(If you have a GMA 3150, get a real GPU.)
	Maximum fog distance is determined by the server in pkg/base/common.lua,
	and is usually 127.5.
	This value will be clamped by the code given by the server.

	"fast_load_screen" is mostly to assist with development.
	Set to true if you want to not draw anything on the loading screen.

	"glsl_shaders" enables GLSL shaders.
	Note, if your GPU doesn't support OpenGL 2.0 or higher,
	these will be unavailable!

	"skins" is explained later in this document.

	"bio" is explained later in this document.

Biography:

These fields are defined:

"description": How you would describe yourself.

"location": Where you are from.

"languages": What languages you speak (an array).
	
	Servers may choose to filter by language.
	
	If you lie about these, expect to get blacklisted.
	
	Current defined languages:
		"de": Deutsch
		"en": English
		"es": Espanol
		"fr": Francais
		"kr": Korean (todo: find the local name for this)
		"pl": Polski
		"pt": Portuguese (todo: find the local name for this)
		"se": Svenska

Skins:

This is not defined yet.

If you wish to add skins, add them to clsave/pub/skin/ DIRECTLY
- that is, do NOT put them into subdirectories! e.g. clsave/pub/skin/music.it
