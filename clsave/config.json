		This file contains configuration for the engine itself.
		It cannot be read by any mods.

		If you have a graphics card that's reasonably fast
		and has at least 128MB of VRAM (64MB *might* cut it),
		set gl_vbo to true.
		(Yes, this DOES help on an Intel 3000 HD.)
		If your game crashes when the map starts appearing, set it to false.

		Do not confuse this with gl_fbo,
		which is useful for render-to-texture stuff,
		but requires a reasonably good GPU.

		If you have an OpenGL-2.0-capable card (or one with non-power-of-two support),
		and you wish to conserve a little bit of VRAM,
		set gl_expand_textures to false.
		If you get white boxes, it obviously wasn't capable - set it to true.
